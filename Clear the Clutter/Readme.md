# Clear the Clutter: Organize Files by Extension
This JavaScript script (clear_the_clutter.js) simplifies file organization. It automatically creates subfolders based on file extensions and moves files into their corresponding folders.
## How it works:
* Reads files in the specified directory (dirtoOrganize).
* Creates subfolders named after extensions (e.g., jpg, txt).
* Moves each file into its matching subfolder.
## To use:
1. Save the code as clear_the_clutter.js.
2. Set dirtoOrganize to the directory you want to organize.
3. Run node clear_the_clutter.js.
