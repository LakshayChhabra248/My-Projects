# üóÇÔ∏è Clear the Clutter: Organize Files by Extension

## `clear_the_clutter.js`: Your Automated File Organizer üöÄ

This JavaScript script is a handy tool that simplifies file organization by automatically sorting files into subfolders based on their file extensions. If you're tired of messy directories and scattered files, this script will bring order to your digital life.

**How It Works:**

*   **Directory Reading:** The script begins by reading all files within a specified directory (you'll define `dirtoOrganize`).
*   **Extension-Based Folders:** It creates subfolders named after the unique file extensions found in the directory (e.g., `jpg`, `txt`, `pdf`, `mp4`, etc.).
*   **File Sorting:** The script then moves each file into the subfolder that corresponds to its extension.
*   **Simplified File Management:** By automatically organizing files, the script saves you time and effort, keeping your directories clean and well-structured.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use:

1.  **Save the Code:** Ensure you save the provided JavaScript code as `clear_the_clutter.js`.
2.  **Set the Target Directory:** Open the `clear_the_clutter.js` file in a text editor, and modify the `dirtoOrganize` variable to the specific directory path you wish to organize. Example:

    ```javascript
    const dirtoOrganize = '/path/to/your/directory'; // Replace with your directory
    ```

3.  **Run the Script:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the `clear_the_clutter.js` file, and run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    node clear_the_clutter.js
    ```

4.  **Observe the Results:** Once the script executes, you'll see new subfolders created within your specified directory, each containing the files of the corresponding extension.
